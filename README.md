Sure, here's a comprehensive `README.md` for the GitHub repository that describes the C program to calculate the sum of steps required for all numbers from 1 to 9999 to reach either 0 or 6174 using the Kaprekar routine:

# Kaprekar Routine Step Counter

This repository contains a C program that calculates the sum of steps required for all numbers from 1 to 9999 to reach either 0 or 6174 (Kaprekar's constant) using the Kaprekar routine.

## Algorithm Description

The Kaprekar routine for a 4-digit number involves the following steps:
1. **Pad the Number**: If the number has fewer than 4 digits, pad it with leading zeros.
2. **Sort the Digits**: Sort the digits of the number in descending order to get `d`.
3. **Sort the Digits**: Sort the digits of the number in ascending order to get `a`.
4. **Compute the Difference**: Compute the new value of the number as `v = d - a`.
5. **Repeat**: Repeat the process until the number becomes 0 or 6174.

## Program Description

The program:
1. Iterates through all numbers from 1 to 9999.
2. Applies the Kaprekar routine to each number.
3. Counts the steps needed for each number to reach 0 or 6174.
4. Sums the steps for all numbers.

## Files

- `main.c`: The main C program implementing the algorithm.

## How to Compile and Run

1. **Compile**: Use a C compiler (e.g., `gcc`) to compile the program.
   ```bash
   gcc -o kaprekar main.c
   ```

2. **Run**: Execute the compiled program.
   ```bash
   ./kaprekar
   ```

## Example Output

The program will output the total number of steps required for all numbers from 1 to 9999 to reach either 0 or 6174 using the Kaprekar routine.

```
Total steps: 25745
```

## Explanation

- **intToStr**: Converts an integer to a 4-character string, padding with zeros if necessary.
- **sortDesc**: Comparator function for sorting characters in descending order.
- **sortAsc**: Comparator function for sorting characters in ascending order.
- **kaprekarRoutine**: Performs the Kaprekar routine, returning the number of steps to reach 0 or 6174.
- **main**: Iterates over all numbers from 1 to 9999, applies the Kaprekar routine, and sums the steps.
